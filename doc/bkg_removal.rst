Background removal
==================

Most of the stacks acquisition techniques can engender a gray intensities increasing or decreasing due for instance to **charging** effects (on low conductive material) or to **shadowing** effects (when carving the material).

The **background removal** process step aims at reducing these effects on the images assuming a polynomial behaviour to be fitted and removed.

.. note::

    This fit is realised through the resolution of a minimization problem with a least square algorithm that consists in 2D to:

    *Given a polynomial basis* :math:`[1, x, y, xy, x^2, ...]`, *find the polynom coefficients* :math:`(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,...)` *such as:*


    .. math::

         \begin{aligned}{\underset {(x, y)\in \mathbb {RxR} \subset Img}{\operatorname {minimize} }}\quad &\|a_0.1 + a_1.x + a_2.y + a_3.xy + a_4.x^2 + ... - Img(x, y)\|^{2}\end{aligned}

    [bkg_removal]
    dim = 3
    poly_basis = "1 + x + y + x*y + x**2 + z"
    #orders = [2, 1, 1]
    #cross_terms = true
    skip_factors = [5, 5, 5]
    threshold_min = 0.5
    #threshold_max = 10.
    #weight_func = "HuberT"


the ``dim`` parameter defines the dimension of the problem to solve (2D or 3D):

* with  ``dim = 3`` a single and potentially high CPU cost resolution is performed on all the stack to determine the polynom coefficients.

* whereas with  ``dim = 2`` the resolution is performed slice by slice leading to different polynom coefficients  from one slice to another one.

The 2D or 3D polynomial basis used to perform the fit can be defined in two ways:

* from ``poly_basis`` which allows to define the polynomial basis **explicitly**, term by term, from a literal expression

* from ``orders`` and ``cross_terms`` which define the basis **implicitly** in function to the order associated to each variable (x, y) in 2D or (x, y, z) in 3D.

Note that in the example above, the two approaches define two different basis. Indeed, in the implicit approach, the cross terms parameter (set to ``true``) generates terms like **z*x*y** and  **z*x**2** that are not present in the literal expression.
In this sense, the explicit approach provides more flexibility in term of the polynomial basis definition.

Since the images sizes and the number of frames could be big, the ``skip_factors`` parameter allows to significantly reduced the array to consider in the fitting processing.
*(Setting a skip_factors = [10, 10, 10] on a stack of size ~1000x1000x1000 seems to be a good compromise between accuracy, RAM occupancy and time execution).*

When a skip factor is applied, the values taken into account are the ones corresponding to the indices positions. Using ``skip_averaging = true`` realizes a local averaging instead. *(Note that no real benefit has been observed practically when activating this averaging).*


Images may include regions that are not impacted (or slightly impacted) by the background effects like holes in a porous medium (characterized by very low values) or saturated pixels (characterized by very high values).
For this reason, a mask to exclude values below ``threshold_min`` and above ``threshold_max`` can be defined to be applied during the fit processing.


At least, the ``weight_func`` parameter ("**HuberT**" or "**Hampel**") can be used to specify a weight function used to determine and exclude outliers during the least squares problem resolution.
See  the `RLM documentation <https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/rlm.html>`_ for more details.
(Default value is HuberT).


Plotting
--------

The special plotting related to the **bkg_removal** process step generates an image in the dedicated **outputs**  folder that is named **coefs.png**.
