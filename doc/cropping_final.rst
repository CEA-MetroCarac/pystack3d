Cropping final
==============


The **cropping final** process step is strictly identical to the `cropping <cropping.html>`_ process step.

It aims at doing a final crop to remove potential artefacts generated by the workflow near the edges of the images due, for instance, to extrapolation effects in the registration process step or to edge-filter limitations during the destriping process step.

The name used (**cropping_final**) allows to create a distinct folder from the **cropping** one.

::

    [cropping_final]
    area = [2, 38, 4, 30]

``area`` indicates the [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] image coordinates to be cropped (in pixel, according to the standard coordinates system with the origin located in the bottom left)
