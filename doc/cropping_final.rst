Cropping final
==============


The **cropping final** process step is strictly identical to the **cropping** process step.

It aims at realising a final crop to remove potential artefacts generated by the workflow near the edges of the images due, for instance, to extrapolation effects in the registration process step or to filter limitation in the destriping process step.

The name used (**cropping_final**) enables to create a distinct folder from the **cropping** one.

::

    [cropping_final]
    area = [2, 38, 4, 30]

``area`` indicates the [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] coordinates (in pixel) of the image to crop in the standard coordinates system (with the origin located in the bottom left)
