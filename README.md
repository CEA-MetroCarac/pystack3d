## Introduction

**PyStack3D** is a package dedicated to images correction intended -for instance- to FIB-SEM stack images postprocessing before image segmentation.

The ``pystack3d`` workflow includes the following process steps which can be activated or not and executed in any order:

- ``cropping`` to reduce the image field of view to a ROI (Region Of Interest)

- ``background removal`` to reduce from polynomial approximations artefacts issued for instance from shadowing, charging, ...

- ``intensity rescaling`` to homogenize the 'gray' intensity distribution between successive frames/slices

- ``registration`` to correct the images misalignment due to shifting, drift, rotation, ... during the images acquisition

- ``destriping`` to minimize artefacts like stripes that can appear in some image acquisition technics

- ``resampling`` to correct non uniform spatial steps

An additional step named `cropping_final` can be used to eliminate artefacts produced near the edges during the image processing or to select another ROI at the end.

## Installation

```
pip install pystack3d
```

## Tests and examples execution

For tests and examples execution, the full ``pystack3d`` project has to be installed via ``git``:

```
    git clone https://github.com/CEA-MetroCarac/pystack3d.git
    cd [path_to_your_pystack3d_project]
```

Once the project has been cloned, the python environment has to be created and completed with the ``pytest`` package (for testing):

```
    pip install .
    pip install pytest
```

Then the tests and the examples can be executed as follows:

```
    pytest
    cd examples
    python ex_synthetic_stack.py
    python ex_real_stack.py
```

## Usage

Refer to the [PyStack3D documentation](https://cea-metrocarac.github.io/pystack3d/getting_started.html).
