  abstract     = {Volume Electron Microscopy (VEM) is an essential tool for studying biological structures. Due to the challenges of sample preparation and continuous volumetric imaging, image artifacts are almost inevitable. Such image artifacts complicate further processing both for automated computer vision methods and human experts. Unfortunately, the widely used Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) can alter the essential relative contrast information about some biological structures. We developed an image-processing pipeline to remove the artifacts and enhance the images without CLAHE. We apply our method to VEM datasets of a Microwasp head. We demonstrate that our method restores the images with high fidelity while preserving the original relative contrast. This pipeline is adaptable to other VEM datasets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
